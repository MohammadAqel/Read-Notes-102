In the beginning, this topic talks about the text editor, its importance and types . So 
? What is a text editor
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer
Important features in the text editor : 
1.) code completion; 2.) syntax
highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them. You might find some other
features that are must-have’s, but I think these features are a good
start.
A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code
completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing
you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos .
Another nice feature is being able to write your HTML and CSS more
efficiently. There is a kind of shorthand language called Emmet that
can help. Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can
imagine. Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or
Emmet can be added by the means of an extension.
Another feature you should definitely look into is called syntax
highlighting. Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes
are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color
than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an
error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read.
The next feature that you should look for in a text editor is a nice
series of themes. These themes will allow you to change the color of
the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text,
and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing
software as well. Usually, web developers use a dark background and
brightly colored text. This combination seems to be easier on the eyes
—but there are other themes to choose from as well. Since you’ll be
using your text editor most of the time, it’s good to find a theme that
might reduce eye strain and fatigue.
Using The Software That Already
Comes With Your Computer
Now that we’ve talked about some of the features one might be
interested in if they were interested in a text editor. Let’s talk about
some of your options—beginning with the software that comes on your computer such as :
NotePad++ is a free text editor for Windows Computers only.
NotePad++ has been around for many years and many web
developers swear by NotePad++. It has syntax highlighting and code
completion, as well as word completion and function completion. It
has a zoom in an out feature, it’s own online community, and its own
chat room for questions that may arise. It even has its own searchable
wiki page for more assistance .
TextWrangler is for Mac computers only, and you used to be able to
download it from the Mac App Store. In doing my research for this
blog post, I’ve come to find out that TextWrangler has been retired. I
know, I’m a little late to the party with this news, but TextWrangler
was retired in 2017. This was one of the go-to text editors for Mac
Computers.
But all hope is not lost, the folks that make TextWrangler, Bare Bones
Software has incorporated TextWrangler into its more robust, big
brother, BB Edit—another feature packed text editor .
BB Edit is software that you purchase. But BB Edit comes with a 30-
day free trial. After the 30 days is over, if you still want the free.
Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft.
It is available for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux
computers. VS Code has the Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS
already built-in with no additional work from you at all. VS Code has
everything: syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code
completion. It seems like VS Code has a very healthy following in the
web developing community.
If you want to try using the text editors that come with your
computer, there’s a couple of caveats that I’d like to make you aware
of:
Please make sure that when you use the text editor that comes on
your computer, that you’re creating code in a plain text editor. You
should not see options for making text bold, underlined, or italic.
Plain text has no formatting options. There is no need to bold,
underline or italicize code. If you can make your text bold, underlined
or italic, then you might need to change a setting somewhere. Please
make sure you’re coding in plain text.
Also, make sure that when you use the text editor that comes on your
.computer, that you first create a folder

Also, please make sure that when you’re saving your file, that they
have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names. For
example, your main HTML file should be called, “index.html.” Your
CSS file should be called something like “style.css.” The filename isn’t
as important as the extension (the “.html” and the “.css”)

. In addition to other types
