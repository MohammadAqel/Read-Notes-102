## Access – combining data
### Types of operators :

*There are four types of operators that can be used in expressions:*
1. #### Comparison operators :
*Comparison operators are usually used on numeric or date fields, but can also be used on text fields:*

> greater than
>= greater than or equal to
< less than
<= less than or equal to
= is equal to
<> is not equal to

2. #### arithmetic operators :
*Arithmetic operators perform math operations:*

+ for addition
– for subtraction
– (unary) changes a negative number to a positive number
* multiplies two numbers
/ divides numbers
\ divides the first value by the second value and rounds to the nearest integer
∧ raises to the exponent value of the second number

3. #### miscellaneous operators
*Miscellaneous operators include Like, Between … And, In, and Is Null.
The Like operator can be used with literals and the two wildcards in Access. The question mark (?) stands for one character; the asterisk (*) stands for a group of characters:*

Like “He?d” could find Head, herd, etc.
Like “T?” could find To, ta, etc.
Like “T*” finds any word beginning with T.
Like “*fore*” will find forehead, before, or any word that contains the letters “fore”.
Like “1/*/2011” finds any date in January, 2011.
Like “text here” is the equivalent to begins with “text here” is an exact match

4. #### Logical operators
*Logical operators combine or modify True/False expressions:*

And: Both expressions are true
Or: At least one expression is true
Not: Matches records when the expression is not true
Xor: Matches records when only one of the expressions is true.
Exclusive Or.
Eqv: Matches records when both expressions are true, or when both expressions are false. Equivalence.
Imp: Matches when the second expression is true or when expression 1 is true and expression 2 is false. Implication.

## Operators and Loops

*The code can take more than one path in flowchart script as it behaves differently depending upon how the user interacts with the web page and/or the browser window itself from here comes the need to handle these paths programmers often rely upon the following three concepts:*

1. ### EVALUATIONS You can analyze values in your scripts to determine whether or not they match expected results.

2. ### DECISIONS Using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down. The flowchart can help at making paths. For decision there are two components : a) An expression is evaluated, which returns a value b) A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation.

3. ### LOOPS can execute a block of code several times... Different Kinds of Loops: A) for - loops through a block of code several times B) while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

1. ### The syntax of a for loop :
*for ( init; condition; increment ) { statement(s); }*

2. ### The syntax of the while loop :
*init. while (Condition) { statements ; update; }*

## USING IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS:-
*An if ... else statement allows you to provide two sets of code:*

1. ### one set if the condition evaluates to true.
2. ### another set if the condition is false the statements inside if a statement should be followed by a semicolon, but there is no need to place one after the closing curly brace of the code blocks.

## A switch statement:-
*A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.*

## IF ...ELSE & SWITCH:-

### IF ... ELSE : There is no need to provide an else option. (You can just use an if statement.) • With a series of if statements, they are if all checked even a match has been found (so it performs more slowly than switch).

### SWITCH : You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match. • If a match is found, that code is run; then the break statement stops the rest of the switch statement running (providing better performance than multiple if statements).
